FreeBSD test suite - pf
=======================

(Current as of 20170828.)

These tests use kyua and ATF.  They create and run VMs with bhyve, and
use these machines to run various test scenarios.


Requirements
------------

The test require that the host supports bhyve and the following
modules:

* bridgestp - for bridge networking for inter-virtual machine
  communication
* if_bridge - for bridge networking
* if_tap - for host-to-virtual machine communication
* nmdm - for virtual serial consoles
* vmm - for running virtual machines
* zfs - for creating and cloning virtual machine images

The tests require that a ZFS storage pool exists on the system named
"zroot", and use the subtree under "zroot/tests/pf" to clone and
configure VM images to be used with bhyve.

The tests also require an active internet connection, as required
packages are installed during creation of the virtual machine base
image, as many of the test scenarios use scapy for traffic generation
and inspection.


Names and numbers used
----------------------

The following names and numbers have been chosed for use in the tests,
as a way to avoid collisions with other installed packages on the host
system:

* Bhyve guests: all virtual machine as named as tests-pf-*
* Bridge interfaces: bridge6555 to bridge6558
* File system: the mountpoint of ZFS dataset "zroot/tests/pf" is used
* IPv4 addresses: block 10.135.213.0/24 is used
* IPv6 addresses: block fd22:27ca:58fe::/48 is used
* Installation location: /usr/tests/sys/netpfil/pf
* Tap interfaces: tap19302 to tap19317
* Virtual consoles: /dev/nmdmtests-pf-*[AB]


Required packages
-----------------

The following packages are automatically installed on the virtual
machine base image.  No packages are installed on the host machine.

* python2.7
* scapy


Installation
------------

The tests are shipped as part of the FreeBSD source.  They are
installed as part of the FreeBSD test suite, which is installed by
default when installing FreeBSD from source starting with version 11.
To install the tests manually:

    % cd {sourcedir} (/usr/src or other)
    % cd tests/netpfil/pf
    % make
    # make install (as root)

The tests should appear under /usr/tests/sys/netpfil/pf.  If not,
creating the directory hierarchy manually might be needed:

    # mkdir -p /usr/tests/sys/netpfil/pf (as root)

The hierarchy is created automatically when the tests are installed as
part of the complete test suite, which is recommended.


First time preparation
----------------------

Before being able to run any tests, the virtual machine base image
needs to be created.  To do that, as root:

    # /usr/tests/sys/netpfil/pf/files/make_baseimg.sh {sourcedir}

{sourcedir} can be /usr/src or anywhere the FreeBSD source is
installed.

make_baseimg.sh will rebuild world and kernel and create a FreeBSD
ready-to-run image.  It will then create a ZFS dataset under "zroot"
named "zroot/tests/pf" and copy the image there for the tests to be
able to find.


Running tests
-------------

The tests use kyua and ATF, and the usual administration commands work
here as well.  To run the tests, first:

    % cd /usr/tests/sys/netpfil/pf

Then, to list all available tests:

    % kyua list

To run all the tests:

    % kyua test

To run a specific test:

    % kyua test {desired_test}

Note that only one test can be run at a time!  That is because the
tests use the same names for creating virtual machines, and running
multiple tests in parallel will create a collision.  Running all the
tests as above will run them one by one, so that will not create any
problem.


Architecture of the tests
-------------------------

The tests use the test frameworks kyua and ATF, so every execution of
a test gets its own empty temporary working directory, which is
cleaned up afterwards by the test framework.  The tests have also
access to the "source directory", which is the installation directory
where the kyua command is issued.  This directory is used for reading
configuration and running helper scripts and functions.

Before running any of the tests, the virtual machine base image needs
to be created.  It is placed in the "zroot/tests/pf" ZFS dataset,
making it easy for the tests to find.  This image is cloned by the
control script every time a test is run.

The main test script is pf_test, which is run by the framework.  This
script cooperates with the VM control script vmctl.sh via utility
functions in pf_test_util.sh.  The main script takes care of network
device allocation, address assignment, and VM naming, while the VM
control script takes care of creating and configuring VM images and
starting and stopping VMs.  These two scripts communicate via command
line arguments and local files created in the ATF working directory.

All VMs need at least one interface to run SSH on, and preferably more
interfaces for running tests.  The VM control script vmctl.sh receives
the list of interfaces from pf_test, configures them such that SSH is
enabled on the first interface, and writes out login information in
local files for pf_test to read back.

The pf_test script needs to wait for the VMs to boot up and get ready.
This takes between 60 and 120 seconds, and depends on various factors
such as the number of network interfaces for the VM.  To work around
this, there is currently a hardcoded call to sleep(1) for each
individual test.

When the VMs are up and runnning, the main script pf_test uses the SSH
connections to make further configuration before the tests start.  It
also takes care of wiring the VMs according to the test scenario,
using local bridge interfaces.

Typically, there will be two VMs, one running pf and one generating
traffic.  Each VM will have two interfaces, one for running SSH and
one for connecting to the other VM via a network bridge running on the
host.  But more complicated scenarios than this can also be created.

In the installation directory, under files/, various test scripts
exist, written in Python and using scapy, which can be uploaded to the
VMs by pf_test.  The test scripts usually need configuration, which is
also uploaded to the VMs by pf_test.  The host itself, running pf_test
and vmctl.sh, does not run any tests directly, that is it does not run
pfctl, pf, or generate any traffic.  This is only done by the VMs.

Tearing down and cleaning up after testing is done by pf_test, which
delegates VM destruction to vmctl.sh and cleans up everything else by
itself.


Future work
-----------

Below are some areas of improvement for the pf tests:

* Ability to run multiple tests simultaneously: The main issue is
  naming of the virtual machines, but other issues might also need
  attention.

* Start-up of virtual machines: Currently the tests wait for a
  predefined amount of time, hardcoded as a call to sleep(1), until
  the virtual machines are done booting.  A way to directly check the
  status of a virtual machine would be desirable.  Perhaps by reading
  from the virtual console?

* Ease of creating new tests: Currently there is a lot of boilerplate
  code when creating a test (in the body and cleanup function of the
  test).  A way to simplify this would be desirable.  Perhaps create a
  set of main test cases holding default configuration, that can be
  branched off and modified?
